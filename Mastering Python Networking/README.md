# Mastering Python Networking
This is the code repository for [Mastering Python Networking](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-python-networking?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784397005), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book begins with a review of the TCP/ IP protocol suite and a refresher of the core elements of the Python language. Next, you will start using Python and supported libraries to automate network tasks from the current major network vendors. We will look at automating traditional network devices based on the command-line interface, as well as newer devices with API support, with hands-on labs. We will then learn the concepts and practical use cases of the Ansible framework in order to achieve your network goals.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 12 does not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
# This is a comment
print("hello world")
```

It is strongly recommended that you follow and practice the examples given in this book. To complete the examples, you will need a host machine that runs Python 2.7 and 3.4, with enough administrative permissions to install the tools introduced in the book. The host machine can be a virtual machine and should preferably run a flavor of Linux. In the book, we'll use Ubuntu 16.04, but other Linux distributions should work as well. You might need to tweak your settings accordingly. In addition, either physical or virtual network equipment is needed to test your code.
